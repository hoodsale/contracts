/**
 * @title V4PositionLocker
 * @notice Holds a launch's Uniswap v4 liquidity until a given time, the way LiquidityLocker holds
 *         V2 LP tokens. On v4 a position is an NFT rather than a balance, so the lock is proved by
 *         this contract owning the position: anyone can check `ownerOf` on the PositionManager.
 *
 *         While locked, the position keeps earning the pool's LP fee, and the lock owner can take
 *         those fees out without touching the principal. The principal itself can only leave
 *         through `unlock`, after the time is up; the period can be extended, never shortened.
